# derive
Just another pretending code generator

Based in previous and current professional experience, trying to create my own code generator out of custom models.

Models will be based partially in some UML diagrams adding some BPMN, BPEL notation.

These models must be platform independent, PIM, if possible exportable to XMI, BPMN, etc.. and other formats, and using a Model transformation language generate full applications. 

The idea is to generate, on the one hand, full applications in working source code, from database to IU in different platforms, desktop, web (responsive), mobile devices, IoT, just microservice, rest APIs, etc.. and also an engine capable of "running" these models like BPM engines do.
